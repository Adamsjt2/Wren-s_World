This website is designed to be a photo biography site dedicated to my daughter. Some parts are meant to be updated regularly such as her likes and dislikes and a current picture.  The text content is mostly filler but styled how I would like the site to look like. The navbar links all do something, the momma and dadda links don't go anywhere but alerts are supposed to pop up saying they lead nowhere but the recent, first steps, and day zero links all take you the their designated photo and open the appropriate caption.
    
My main JavaScript function allows you to click pictures in the main gallery and captions about what's happening in the picture will show below the clicked picture and be hidden again when another picture is clicked or the same picture is clicked a second time.

There is a print media query that hides all but the header picture and shows the image captions.
