This website is designed to be a photo biography site dedicated to my daughter. Some parts will be updated regularly such as her likes and dislikes and a current picture.  The content is mostly filler but a close representation of what I would like the site to look like. Also, the nav bar doesn't work but it is intended to take you to mom and dad profile pages and certain major milestones like birthdays.
    
My JavaScript function allows you to click pictures in the main gallery and captions about what's happening in the picture will show below the clicked picture and be hidden again when another picture is clicked or the same picture is clicked a second time.

There is a print media query that hides all but the header picture and shows the image captions.
